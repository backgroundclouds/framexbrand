When you're bidding (or actualizing) a commercial film shoot, there are a couple of different budget software’s you can use. But it's worth mentioning, almost everyone uses Hot Budget. Regardless, it merits a rundown to see what's out there, how they compare, and what any industry context might be.

Occasionally someone new to the bidding world (whether they be in-house or outer-market) may try to use a format that is a bit **outside the lines**. Something that's _'more intuitive'_ to them. These typically don’t work out well.

And it’s worth keeping in mind— _if you're bid can't actualize correctly, you're not actually bidding correctly_.

**Principally a commercial budgeting** software does the following with ease.

- Work easily w/ the [AICP Bid Format](https://aicp.com/assets/editor/AICP_bidform_2019_FINAL.pdf)­­ 
- PO's
- PC
- Freelance day-rates **->** Payroll
- Top Line Costs with detailed tier and client breakdowns.

To date, there are primarily 2 options for commercial bidding. **Hot Budget or Showbiz.** And although there are others, they are lesser known, and lesser used.

## Hot Budget
### The industry standard

As stated, **Hot Budget** is the industry standard. At this point it's what every other bidding software is modeled after.  It's built [on top](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery?tabs=yeomangenerator) of Excel, and is therefore lightweight and efficient. Utilizing JavaScript Hot Budget utilizes Excel's [VBA software](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office)  and macro plugins to make a straightforward budgeting software.

#### **Context-**

Created by [Hot Bricks](https://hotbricks.com/), an expendables company based out of LA. I find it very interesting that the industry’s leading standard for commercial budgets, is also a place that you can rent folding tables from.

#### Rundown-

Hot Budget does all of the things you want a commercial bidding software to do, with none of the glam. Hot Budget boots up with the AICP template built in, and although I think there's a way to insert other templates (feature-lengths, etc.) I've never had the call to.

- Top Page recognized as the industry norm    
- Easy CSV import / export
- General ease of navigation.
- Day-rate calculations w/ various Base + OT + Fringe adjustments
- Travel Bids, Overage Logs, PO Logs
- PC Grids, Payroll Log, Etc, Etc,.    
#### Cost

Hot Bricks charges $100 per year for subscription access to bidding software, per device. For most freelancers in the production game, this cost is written off on the first job of the year. However, I’ve also had the lovely peeps at [Hot Bricks](https://hotbricks.com/) throw in an extra subscription, when renting expendables from them.
#### The Gossip
![](/assets/images/posts/best-budgeting/runtime_funtime.png)

It's worth noting, that prior to 2023 Hot Budget was prone to bugs. It's 2023 update seems to have solved all of that. The bugs were seldom serious enough to be detrimental to the use of Hot Budget. In fact they were somewhat part of its charm. It's 2023 update ([Hot Budget version 3](https://downloads.hotbudget.com/HotBudget_v3.0_UserGuide.pdf)) has been impressive in terms of how uncharacteristically smooth it has made the application. No longer do you see runtime errors, so long are the days of 2014, or 2022 for that matter.

## Showbiz
### The Visual Alternative
**Showbiz** is the graphical counterpart to Hot Budget. It of course does everything that Hot Budget does, but with more buttons, more colors and more buttons.

It's level of options are probably what some find frustrating about it. Of course, if you're a grownup this learning curve will pass.

![](/assets/images/posts/best-budgeting/ShowbizScreenshot_1-2.png)

#### **Context-**
[Showbiz](https://www.mediaservices.com/showbiz-software/showbiz-budgeting/#tab-summary) was made by the payroll company [Media Services](https://www.mediaservices.com/showbiz-software/), which was [acquired](https://deadline.com/2020/02/cast-and-crew-acquires-media-services-rival-hollywood-1202860500/) by payroll company Cast & Crew some years back. I don't have many positive things to say about Media Services, but Showbiz is definitely one of them. And the other would be its super useful [Showbiz Labor Guides](https://laborguide.mediaservices.com/labor-guide/overview/).
#### Rundown-

- Everything that Hot Budget does
- **Sophisticated Customization Display Options**
- **Sophisticated Customization Calculation Options**
- **Sophisticated Customization Export and PDF Options** - PDF a bid side by side with an actual. PDF an actual with costs displayed in various formats.
- Vast detail input panes for any line item
- The ability to itemize detailed costs in your Working, or Bid
- Sophisticated Fringe & OT Presets you can save and apply as needed
- A standalone Detail Browser
- **The PO log is ALSO the PO book.**
- More sophisticated PC reconciliation
- Colors & Buttons..

Everything mentioned is fun. But for me the biggest advantage is its PO book function. From a PM standpoint this eliminates the redundancy of an external PO book, which is the standard Hot Budget workflow.

It should be noted Showbiz also has a standalone PC app, PO app, and Timecard app. It's PC and PO app being free. All three of these seem needlessly superfluous to me, as Showbiz already captures everything you could want in a budget program.

#### Cost-

The cost has gone up recently. From $350 to $400 for 2x lifetime installations.

Media Services is pretty flexible with the installations. I've removed old installations from old macs, and i've bought extra subscriptions to give out on loan. Giving said subscriptions out, as well as revoking them has been a pretty seamless process, requiring nothing more than a single email to [showbiz@mediaservices.com](http://showbiz@mediaservices.com/)

I've also been able to email Showbiz support staff about technical questions, with pretty quick response times.

## Showbiz vs HotBudget

I don't take a hard position for either. Considering Hot Budget's most recent update, I have no complaints about it. Hot Budget is simpler, cheaper, more lightweight, and universally understood., So in that sense it's easier to work with. Showbiz is more sophisticated, and allows for more iterative detail exploration. Its PO log doubling as a PO book is definitely a bonus as well

#### **Preferences:**
- For jobs 1M ↑, definitely Showbiz. On these occasions, the more sophisticated browsing comes in handy.
- Otherwise, no preference.

## The Lesser Known Alternatives
There are a handful of alternatives worth mentioning.

### Point Zero
**Point Zero** feels like a knockoff of Hot Budget, **but only if** it was procured from the Hackney Market in East London.

It's best described as Hot Budget with less functionality and appeal. This tracks though, considering the software dates back from the 90's, and it's likely the very thing Hot Budget was modeled after.

#### **The Tech-**

Like Hot Budget, Point Zero it is built on top of Excel via Visual Basics Application of Macro's. However it's an older version of excel, so it uses the old school excel **.xls**, instead of the modern **.xlsx**'s or **.xlsb**'s. For those with a modern 365 subscription, this difference is minutia. But from an architectural standpoint, the old school excels were comprised of binary and did not translate well across software’s or formats. The modern Excel formats are comprised of XML an opensource format, and easily open up on different systems or software types.

#### **Function**

Point Zero is essentially Hot Budget with much less functionality. If it "had" any pro's, it would be that it _was_ less buggy than Hot Budget. That is until the Hot Budget 2023 update came around.  

#### **Context**

Point Zero dates back into the 90's. I've been able to find no official arbiters or odes to its origins. Not so much as a website, or a LinkedIn page exists. After doing some digging into the Point Zero files that I have, I've been able to find this tiny bit of meta data. See screenshot below.

*© 1996-2000 PointZero Productions. All Rights Reserved.*

**All Rights Reserved to who?** I attempted to reach the phone number hidden in the meta data, but unfortunately it seems to be dead.

#### **What i've heard.**

- Point Zero and Hot Budget were made by the same person
- Point Zero was made by a fellow named Jay Wakefield.  

If you're familiar, or would like to corroborate some context, shoot [me](mailto:josh@jpax.tv) a message or a drop a comment.

### True Budget
[True Budget](https://truebudget.io/) is essentially an _improved_ version of Hot Budget. It's smoother, more intuitive, slightly more graphical, and has a handful of added features.

#### **Rundown**
- It does everything that Hot Budget does
- No bugs
- Ribbon buttons and functions
- Fixes broken sheets
- Importable/Exportable Chart of Accounts functionality
- PO log to PO book seamless PDF functionality
- Travel Budget is built in, and doesn't require appendage like Hot Budget
- Crew Headcount Feature
- Fine point adjustment of Prod. Fee Feature

**The PO Log to PO Book feature is the real standout feature.** Especially considering Hot Budget's PO workflow was the number one con, when comparing it to Showbiz.

![](/assets/images/posts/best-budgeting/True-Budget-Screenshot.png)

#### **Context-**

Murmur is, that the designer(s) of True Budget, were motivated by none other than **repeated Hot Budget runtime errors**. Regardless, each of the features comes across as thoughtful and well designed. To date True Budget is very much a lesser known budget software in the commercial bidding game. It's available for free, possibly because of how unknown it is? It's also backed by the folks at [Revolution](https://www.revolutiones.com/) payroll.

Also. Also. I have the sneaking opinion- that [Hot Budget's version 3](https://downloads.hotbudget.com/HotBudget_v3.0_UserGuide.pdf) update came only after the emergence of True Budget. Likely very much _because_ of True Budget.

## The Less Relevant Alternatives
I've seen some blogs list other budget software’s, but I’m yet to meet anyone in the commercial world who actualizes their bids in the likes of **Movie Magic** or **Celtx**. While they might make good for blog fodder, (or features ?) let's be realistic…

There's also [GetActual](https://getactual.io/). It's pitch is that it's a live budget software, and multiple parties can work on the same budget at once. Personally I haven't known cloud limitations to be a significant challenge in my workflows. My concern would be the potential for any lag. I've seen bookkeeping applications suffer from this same feature in [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/us/books/) & [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/live/).

GetActual could hold up though. 🤷‍♂️ I'm not sure as I haven't used it.

## Thoughts
**I would be curious to know what live time functionality would look like on Hot Budget or True Budget?** Excel itself, does have [real time](mailto:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/edit-in-real-time-with-friends-and-family-ec46367f-ec02-4896-bf2b-3ecd7db77697) functionality, but this is yet to be implemented in either application.

**Recently [Python was announced as being available within Excel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/introducing-python-in-excel-the-best-of-both-worlds-for-data/ba-p/3905482).** Exciting news for programmers. I'm curious to see what affects (if any) it has on bidding excel formats.

All in all, **my favorite in the mentioned is definitely True Budget.** It's simple, light weight, efficient, and just graphical enough to increase it's functionality. Also it's an underdog, so you have to root for it. But in all seriousness Hot Budget and Showbiz are always great options as well, they're both well maintained, and remain industry standards. In all practicality, this is typically determined by the EP, or the bidding producer anyway, so if that’s not you, it's helpful to be fluid with all of them.
